            <h2>To our ICT Teacher, Mr Jordy.</h2>
            <p><b>Yes, we can only say 2 simple words that you must have heard often, "thank you," and those words are very worthy to be given to you not only because you give us knowledge but also because you show that in school we can also be noticed, and we can change one of them because of you. You are really unique because you try to be an annoying teacher for us so that we are triggered and try to surpass you. <br>
                Your character is very unique. Even though I hope you will cry reading this letter, which is impossible, so yeah, what else can I do? We just want to say thank you because you not only teach well in class but you are also really fun and really care about us, which even though it is not visible but can be felt. Your lessons are one of the lessons we're most looking forward to, not only because they're fun, but because you also deliver the material in a fun way, and your delivery method is always fun and enjoyable, <br>
                which makes ICT lessons not boring. Lastly, Happy Teacher's Day! </b></p>
